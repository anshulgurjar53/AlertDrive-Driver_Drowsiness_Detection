# AlertDrive-Driver_Drowsiness_Detection
AlertDrive is a cutting-edge driver drowsiness detection system that utilizes IoT sensors and machine learning algorithms, ensuring road safety by continuously monitoring driver alertness. The integration of IoT  and machine learning models enables real-time analysis of facial features to detect signs of drowsiness.AlertDrive is an intelligent system designed to enhance road safety by detecting signs of driver drowsiness in real-time. This repository contains the source code and documentation for implementing the Driver Drowsiness Detection system using computer vision and deep learning techniques.

# Key Features
- **OpenCV and Keras Integration**: Utilizes OpenCV for capturing and processing real-time video footage, while Keras is employed to develop a deep learning model for facial feature and eye movement analysis.

- **ESP32 Cam Module**: The hardware backbone of the system, capturing continuous video feed of the driver's face for seamless integration with the software components.

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Constantly monitors the driver's facial features, interpreting them through computer vision algorithms to assess the level of alertness.

- **Deep Learning Model**: A robust Keras-based model trained on a dataset of facial expressions and eye movements, capable of making real-time predictions about the driver's state.

- **Alert Mechanism**: Triggers alerts, such as visual warnings, auditory alerts, or haptic feedback, upon detecting signs of drowsiness to prompt the driver to take corrective action.
